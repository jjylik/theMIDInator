# theMIDInator
TheMIDInator is a MIDI controller based on an Arduino MEGA 2560. It uses a few potentiometers, rotary encoders, a joystick, switches and a keypad as inputs and sends MIDI commands via serial USB interface to the computer. For this controller to work properly a program such as Hairless MIDI to Serial Bridge needs to be running on the computer to receive the commands. This can then be piped into your DAW of choice.
